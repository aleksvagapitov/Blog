Tabulator is a Javascript framework for creating Data Driven Tables that provides lots of functionality out of the box for server-side as well as front-end: sorting, filtering, exporting and many many more awesome features. Having used tools like: Handsontable, Datatables as well as custom Razor Pages; I decided to try Tabulator, and found it to be the optimal solution that provides all of the functionality that I want at no cost, with great flexibility, and requires a relatively small amount of front-end code. In this article, I will give you a tour of how this awesome Javascript framework works effectively with ASP.NET Core and EntityFramework. All of the code from this article can be found here.

We can install it using Dotnet CLI using the following command: | dotnet add package EntityFrameworkPaginateCore –version 1.1.0 The sample project on Github contains all the required packages and all you need to do is follow instruction in the README of the project. The repository structure relies on the following method signature: Task\u003cTabulatorViewModel\u003e GetFilteredData (int page, int size, List\u003cDictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e\u003e filters, List\u003cDictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e\u003e sorters) What is important to note here is the type of ‘filters’ and ‘sorters’ parameters, which is: List\u003cDictionary\u003cstring, string\u003e\u003e since we will be getting filters in the following format: [{field:\"age\", type:\"\u003e\", value:52}, {field:\"height\", type:\"\u003c\", value:142}] and for sorters: [{field: \"age\", dir: \"asc\"}] What is also important is the ViewModel that we use to pass the data back to the Tabulator: public class TabulatorViewModel { public IEnumerable\u003cdynamic\u003e Data { get; set; } public int Last_page { get; set; } } The full method is described here and mostly comprises of iterating over the list of dictionary items and setting the fields and values for each of the columns described in the Model that was mentioned at the beginning of the blog.

What is very handy about this structure is that we can remove columns from the front-end without having to adjust the back-end. However, be careful with the objects that you are passing to the front-end and check what your API returns. The way we can ensure that data does not get leaked is by using ViewModels and AutoMapper or regular object-composition to pass only the relevant data to the front-end. I have left a commented out line in the Repository method implementation of where the AutoMapper clause would go as to not introduce too many concepts in this blog. Lastly, you can use tools like Postman to query the API and see the data that it returns.
